# Write a program using a while loop that asks the user to enter a number that is divisible by 2.
number = eval(input('Enter an even number.'))
while number%2 == 0:
    print('good job!')
while number%2 != 0:
    print('bad job!')
# Don't let them stop until they enter an even number! Print a congratulatory message when they *finally* get it

# This line will ask the user for an even number.

# 2. Inside the while loop What will you need to do? Don't forget to tab in!

# 3. Once the user has entered an even number, congratulate them!
