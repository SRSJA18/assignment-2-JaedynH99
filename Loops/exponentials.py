# Write a program using a for loop that calculates exponentials. Your program should ask the user for a base
# (base) and an exponent (exp), and calculate base**exp without using the ** operator.

# These lines ask the user for input
base = input("Base?")
exp = input("Exponent?")

# 1. Use a for loop with a range statement to compute the final value. (Hint: think about initializing the
#    final value to 1 before the loop.

# 2. Print the fina value.
