**Rock, Paper and Scissors**

The first program in this assignment asks you to create the game Rock, Paper, Scissors using if statements. 
Please see the PDF file in the folder for instructions.

**Loops**

Four simple programming assignments to exercise your loop skills. 
1. *fractions* will ask you to use a for loop to compute the values of
fractions from 1/2, 1/3 ... 1/10.
2. *countdown* is a simple while loop based program that counts down to zero. Why would this be better as a for loop?
3. *exponentials* Python already has an exponential operator (**), but in this exercise we write a for loop to compute
exponential values.
4. *even_number* Let's test the user to see if he knows what an even number is. Keep asking until he gets it right.
Remember, you can use the modulo operator (%) to determine if a number is even or odd.
